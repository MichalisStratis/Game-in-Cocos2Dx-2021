- ðŸ‘‹These classes are my contribution in a game made at the Birmingham City University-Gamer Camp MSc Video Game Development named Impossible Rescue. 
<!---
My name is Michalis Stratis, and I am a post-graduate student of MSc Video Game Development at Birmingham City University expected to graduate in September 2022. The subjects 
I covered throughout my 4 years of studies in both Liverpool Hope University and Birmingham City University have been fascinating to study and very helpful for me, as I sharpened 
my skills in many different programming languages and engines.  I had the privilege to study fields like Object-Oriented-Programming, the Internet of Things, Networks, 
Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and many other exciting courses. Although the main discipline that caught my attention and made me fall in love with it was working 
on game engines like Love Engine, Cocos2D-X, Unity and Unreal Engine. I have always been a huge gamer and imagination has always been a big part of my personality so working on 
creating new worlds and environments helped me realize that this is indeed the path I want to follow in my career, creating games.
